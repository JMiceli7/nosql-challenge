In this assignment, I utilized MongoDB to navigate a database of various food and drink related establishments. The data collected from these establishments were important for journalists and food critics of a magazine to decide where to focus future articles.

With the help of MongoDB I was able to view the database of entries, add and update entries to the database, as well as manipulate the data into dataframes for better processing and analysis.
